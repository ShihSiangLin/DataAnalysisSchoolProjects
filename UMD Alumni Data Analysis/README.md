# Alumni Event Analytics & Prediction System

## Executive Summary
Implementation of data-driven analytics and predictive modeling system for alumni event optimization, focusing on first-time attendance and major prospect ($50,000+ donors) conversion rates.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Dataset consolidation: Multi-sheet integration
   - Temporal feature engineering: Weekend flags, event date parsing
   - Categorical encoding: Label encoding for non-numeric features
   - Final schema: 22 normalized columns

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Primary dimensions: Activity, Location, Group codes
   - Temporal analysis: Month, Day-type (weekday/weekend)
   - Target variables: Participation rate, Major prospect %, First-time attendee %

### Predictive Models

#### Major Prospects Model
- **Architecture**: Non-parametric Gaussian & Kernel Regression
- **Features**:
  - Participation metrics
  - Encoded location codes
  - Encoded group codes
  - Encoded activity codes
- **Performance**: MSE = 142
- **Sample Prediction**: Actual(6.00) → Predicted(5.98)

#### First-Time Attendees Model
- **Architecture**: Non-parametric Gaussian & Kernel Regression
- **Performance**: MSE = 1136
- **Sample Prediction**: Actual(10.00) → Predicted(9.84)

## Key Findings

### Temporal Patterns
- **Optimal Timing**:
  - Weekdays: Higher target group engagement
  - Summer period: Increased participation
  - August-October: Peak first-time attendance

### Spatial Analysis
- On-campus social events demonstrate highest engagement
- Online events: Critical for COVID-era adaptation

### Demographic Insights
