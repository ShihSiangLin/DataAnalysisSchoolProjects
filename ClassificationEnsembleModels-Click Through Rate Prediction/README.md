# CTR Prediction Model Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of automated click-through rate (CTR) prediction system using ensemble learning methods. Achieved 65.2% accuracy in distinguishing clicked vs. non-clicked advertisements through automated data preprocessing and model optimization.

## Technical Architecture
- **Data Pipeline**: Kaggle dataset → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation
- **Key Performance**: 65.2% accuracy, 63.8% sensitivity, 65.5% specificity
- **Primary Features**: Temporal patterns, device specifications, website/app characteristics

## Methodology
### Model Selection Process
1. **Algorithm Evaluation**
   - Tested: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Classification Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGB
   - Selected: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Classification Trees as base models
   - KNN excluded due to computational constraints at scale
   - Random Forest preferred for ensemble due to superior performance on imbalanced data

2. **Automation Framework**
   - Automated pipeline for preprocessing, sampling, and modeling
   - Custom ensemble implementation with dynamic feature selection (2-6 predictors)
   - Model-agnostic prediction averaging system

3. **Ensemble Architecture**
   - Balanced Random Forest implementation
   - 375 Classification Trees
   - Dynamic feature selection for model decorrelation

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 65.2%
- **Sensitivity**: 63.8% (clicked ads)
- **Specificity**: 65.5% (non-clicked ads)
- **Variance**: <2% across metrics

## Future Optimizations
1. **Scale Improvements**
   - Increased training data sampling
   - Additional ensemble model integration
   - Deep learning implementation

2. **Infrastructure Upgrades**
   - Migration to distributed computing (Hadoop/Spark)
   - Enhanced preprocessing automation
   - Real-time prediction capabilities

This implementation demonstrates effective CTR prediction through automated ensemble methods, with potential for further optimization through distributed computing and deep learning approaches.
